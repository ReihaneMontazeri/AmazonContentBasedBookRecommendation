# AmazonContentBasedBookRecommendation
This project is a Book Recommendation System built using the Amazon Books dataset. The goal of the project is to help users discover books they will love based on the content of books they've enjoyed in the past. It uses a Content-Based Filtering approach to recommend books based on their descriptions and categories.
